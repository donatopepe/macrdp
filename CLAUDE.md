## Status

Functional v0 — daily-driver usable on a trusted LAN and over the internet
(VPN/ZeroTier). **Latest release: v0.9.41** (the ceiling converges — `--bitrate` stays the operator's MAXIMUM and an **effective** ceiling below it only ever steps DOWN, after 3 congested control intervals, at most once per 5 s, clamped to [half of `--bitrate`, `--bitrate`], published as `effective_ceiling_bps`. **Built three times and measured twice before keeping one**, and the two discarded designs are the point: a symmetric AIMD on the ceiling oscillated 6000k<->750k with 50 convergence events in 90 s, and gating the climb on 'we are pushing the bound' failed identically — because **'congestion cleared' cannot be told apart from 'the AIMD dropped the target and drained the pipe'**, so any climb rule guesses. Floor at half `--bitrate` for the other measured reason: with the encoder's floor it overshot the achievable band and parked at 750k on a link that sustains ~4 Mbit, fixing the oscillation by throwing away detail. Verified here with an unreachable 6 Mbit ceiling + video: ONE step 6000k->3000k, stable 120 s, queue 13-27 ms vs the 101-180 ms of the original cycle, one log line instead of 50. It is a safety net for a badly chosen ceiling, NOT a substitute for measuring one — the measured 4 Mbit remains this host's explicit `config.env`; the binary default is now 10 Mbit after the user's live responsiveness test. Also: the queue-delay reading carries `queue_delay_age_ms` (on a static desktop it kept its last value, so the Status pane showed a congestion number that was history — deliberately NOT decayed, because a client that stopped consuming leaves exactly that backlog and the blank detector reads it). Three open items closed with evidence rather than code: the client graphics PDUs stay unimplemented (zero observed occurrences; a hand-written parser would break the 'ironrdp owns the wire format' convention for a case nothing demonstrates) and the white-screen-after-reconnect is a documented limit. Earlier: **v0.9.20** (input/drop diagnostics + more responsive adaptive bitrate and fps pacing; 234 Rust + 18 Swift tests.) Earlier: **v0.9.19** (input timing + frame-drop-reason telemetry, INFO bitrate/congestion transitions, faster AIMD; no keystroke contents logged. H.264 pipeline bound now 1 frame, lower-latency.) Earlier: **v0.9.19** (adds safe input-handler latency + pre-encode drop-reason telemetry; makes AIMD faster in both directions: 200ms tick/ceiling step, 50% backoff, 1/8-ceiling climb; H.264 in-flight depth defaults to 1 to reduce last-keystroke echo lag. No key data recorded.) Earlier: **v0.9.18** (the lossy-vs-AAC live A/B was contaminated: config parsing mutated process-global UDP gates, so AAC-on/lossy-off did not prove the lossy offer was absent. Fixed: clear/derive gates once in runtime startup after effective args, and log effective flags. Subsequent same-client reliable-AAC/lossy-off session held >2h; mechanism unproven, continue monitor.) Earlier: **v0.9.17** (live A/B isolated the repeated ~65.4s reset to lossy UDP audio being enabled: lossy ON had 62 fixed-interval resets; lossy OFF + reliable AAC ON held the same PC074FG session >27 min, same host/link/bitrate. The mechanism is still unproven, so reliable AAC is the safe default for new installs; existing config.env untouched. Startup now clears stale lossy UDP env gates before applying runtime flags and logs the effective config.) Earlier: **v0.9.16** (the deployment's tested responsive operator bitrate maximum is now the DEFAULT for new installs: `--bitrate` 6 -> **10** in the binary and `BITRATE=10` in the seed; this is a ceiling, not a forced rate, and the effective ceiling backs off under congestion. Existing `config.env` files are untouched; this host retains explicit `BITRATE=4`. User reported 10 Mbit much more responsive in the live trial.) Earlier: **v0.9.15** (lossy audio becomes the global seed; reliable RDPSND AAC and lossy-DVC AAC are mutually exclusive — GUI switch auto-clears the other mode and the server config bridge gives `ENABLE_LOSSY_AUDIO=1` precedence for hand-edited files. User confirmed lossy-only works well; default seed now `ENABLE_LOSSY_AUDIO=1`, `ENABLE_AAC=0`; existing config.env untouched. 232 Rust + 22 Swift tests.) Earlier: **v0.9.15**; Earlier: **v0.9.13** (the tuned deployment's configuration becomes the DEFAULT for every new install — **existing config.env files are untouched**, so no behaviour change for existing installs. `--bitrate` default 6 -> **4** in the binary AND the seed, with the measurement inline: it is a CEILING, not a target, and at 6 Mbit on a ~24 ms ZeroTier path with video playing the rate controller limit-cycled (6000k->1440k->2359k, queue 101-180 ms, **89 IDR backoffs against 89 recoveries**, 1237 write stalls, 91 audio drops) while 4 sat stable at the ceiling with 1 backoff, 50 stalls, 1 audio drop at the same 60 fps. Seeded baseline now: H.264+AAC 128k (legacy bitmaps needed 30 fps to stay watchable on the same link; PCM audio competes with video for the same socket), ADAPTIVE_BITRATE=1 (backs off before the link saturates), STATS_ENDPOINT=1, H264_BLANK_RECOVERY=1 (spelled out: first action heals in place), NO_CLIENT_RESOLUTION=1 (one known resolution makes the bitrate predictable; MAX_CLIENT_SIZE is inert while it is on, and the template now says so), HIDPI=0 with the 35->8.8 milli-bit/pixel measurement attached, and the recommended RUST_LOG with `ironrdp_server::server=warn`. Docs realigned where they asserted the opposite. Earlier: **v0.9.11** (honest telemetry + honest warnings, born from the 2026-10-05 troubleshooting session where the *instrumentation* cost more than the bugs — **no behaviour change on any runtime path, video path deliberately untouched**. The stats endpoint is H.264-only and said so only implicitly: `connected`/`fps`/`bitrate_bps` are written by h264.rs and nowhere else, so with H.264 off a healthy legacy session reported `connected:false` and everything read 0 — the payload now carries `video_path` (egfx-h264 | legacy-bitmap) and the Controller's Status pane says 'AVC telemetry not applicable' instead of zeros that read as a dead session. `--enable-udp-multitransport`'s help now carries its measured hazard: with it ON one Windows client (build 22621) reset every session at a FIXED 65.4 s on both video paths, OFF zero resets, same client, same machine (27 vs 0) — recorded as a correlation, mechanism unproven. And the client-graphics-PDU suspicion is **closed**: with `ironrdp_server::server=warn` visible there are zero 'Unexpected share data pdu', so 'the client asks for a keyframe and we ignore it' was false. docs/conventions.md gains the 'measure before you change a live behaviour' rule. Earlier: **v0.9.10** (the menu bar grows up — **Quit now stops the server** (it used to hide the icon) AND unloads the controller's own login item, because `KeepAlive` was respawning it within a second, so Quit did nothing; verified 0 processes/jobs/listeners and no respawn, with `--stop-all` as the headless equivalent. New in the menu: **Check for updates…** (`releases/latest`, numeric version compare so 0.9.10 beats 0.9.9, SHA-256 verified download, staged swap with rollback, re-signed with the local certificate, and it WARNS when the designated requirement changed — replacing the bundle is the identity change v0.9.8 was about), **Uninstall…** (three buttons plus two unticked checkboxes for `config.env` and the Keychain password; NSAlert carries three buttons max, and it reuses packaging/uninstall-launchagent.sh), and **Sleep ▸** prevent-on-AC vs normal policy with the state checked. Also: a display that is asleep no longer bricks startup — 'no displays available' was fatal, so the agent crash-looped until a human touched the screen (36 respawns), reachable as soon as the sleep policy went AC-only; startup now waits up to ~2 min for a display, and the watcher re-asserts a dead `caffeinate`. New `macrdptray --self-test` (19 checks over every non-GUI path, including the updater against the PUBLISHED SHA256SUMS without installing) and `scripts/test-config-keys.sh`, which round-trips every UI key against the running server — it taught me that you cannot assert a key by grepping the process argv (with `--config` the derived flags never appear there) and that `| grep -q` under `set -o pipefail` SIGPIPEs the writer and makes an assertion lie. 226 Rust + 13 Swift tests. Earlier: **v0.9.9** (the port preflight + the missing uninstaller — **one behaviour change on the default startup path**: a second macrdp that would have quietly shadowed the first now refuses to start. It could not detect this before, and the ordinary bind structurally cannot: tokio binds with SO_REUSEADDR (mio sets it on every socket) and on Darwin a wildcard+REUSEADDR holder lets `127.0.0.1:P` bind *successfully* beside `0.0.0.0:P` — measured matrix in @docs/known-quirks.md; row 2 of it is the detector, verified to work whether or not the holder set the flag, and a *specific*-address holder is deliberately not reported because it cannot shadow anything. `wildcard_listener_present()` runs BEFORE the TCC check, so a misconfigured second instance cannot raise a prompt storm on its way out. Plus `packaging/uninstall-launchagent.sh`, the counterpart to dist/install.sh: unloads the label, removes the plist (else it returns at the next login), clears the recorded identity, and keeps the app bundle / config.env / Keychain unless --remove-app / --purge-config / --purge-keychain — the bundle is opt-out because the TCC grants hang off its code identity. 218 tests (2 new). Earlier: **v0.9.8** (the TCC prompt storm + an explicit
code identity, two install-path defects, and two CI gates that had been red
since v0.9.6 — **the default runtime path is unchanged**, capture/encode/RDP
untouched and the new flag inert unless asked for. **THE HEADLINE:** a launchd
agent without the Screen Recording grant exited 1 and `KeepAlive` respawned it
every ~6-10 s, and merely *attempting* capture is enough for macOS to notify —
`tccd` logs `Notifying for access kTCCServiceScreenCapture … resp=<pid>` once
per respawn, so one macOS dialog every few seconds, FOREVER (37 in 12 h
measured). Suppressing `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` is not enough: the capture
attempt itself prompts. `ensure_screen_recording_access()` now runs FIRST
(before `caffeinate`, the virtual display and any ScreenCaptureKit call) and,
when `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` is set (launchd exports it into every job;
`MACRDP_NO_TCC_PROMPT=1` forces it), logs the actionable message — including
the exact executable path, because the System Settings row is named after the
IDENTITY, not the path — and exits 1. Measured: 4 respawns in 40 s -> 0 prompts;
an interactive session still gets the normal prompt. **The rest:** `dist/install.sh`
no longer ad-hoc signs (a cdhash-keyed signature is revoked by EVERY rebuild,
so it silently dropped the user's grants; it now uses the same
`macrdp Local Code Signing` certificate as `packaging/make-app.sh`, pins
`--identifier macrdp`, prints the designated requirement and warns when it is a
`cdhash` one); the two auto-start paths were both installed and competing on
:3390 (the loser crash-looped on `Address already in use`, and a flagless
instance could bind `127.0.0.1:3390` ALONGSIDE a healthy `0.0.0.0:3390` listener
— macOS allows it — silently serving loopback clients with defaults; mutual
exclusivity is now stated in both README install sections and
`dist/uninstall.sh` exists at last); **new `macrdp --check-permissions`**
answers "why is macOS asking again?" in one command — executable, code
identifier, designated requirement with a STABLE/AD-HOC verdict, both
permission states, exit 1 when unhealthy, no port/capture/dialog — and
`make-app.sh` + `install-launchagent.sh` now WARN when the identity changes,
the one moment a re-grant is actually due; two pre-existing CI gates fixed
(`cargo fmt --check` red since c3dc866, and `-D warnings` on the macOS job vs
`libc`'s deprecated Mach time API, now a documented `frame_age_ms()` helper,
plus clippy's `chunks_exact_to_as_chunks` at all seven sites). Correction on
record: removing every macrdp row from System Settings does NOT revoke the
grant on macOS 27.0.1 (both survived intact, no prompt), so a reboot does not
lose it — use `--check-permissions` rather than inferring from the UI. Earlier:
**v0.9.7** (dependency & security patch — three advisories carried out of the
dependency tree, plus one opt-in UI change; no change to the default runtime
path beyond the updates themselves. **rustls 0.23.40 → 0.23.45** (RUSTSEC-2026-0285): TLS 1.3 handshake messages were accepted at the wrong encryption level — a plaintext `EncryptedExtensions` packed into the same record as the `ServerHello` — where RFC 8446 §5.1 requires an `unexpected_message` alert; the transcript stays authenticated so a network attacker cannot alter or complete a handshake, but this is macrdp's OWN TLS stack, so it headlines the release. **cryptoki 0.12.0 → 0.12.1** (RUSTSEC-2026-0286): the `CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS` byte count was treated as an element count → out-of-bounds slice; reaches macrdp via `sspi` → `ironrdp-connector`. **h2 0.4.14 → 0.4.16** (RUSTSEC-2026-0258). **chacha20 0.10.1 → 0.10.2** — a YANK, not a vulnerability (SSE4.1 intrinsic in the SSE2 backend; nil exposure on Apple Silicon/Intel Macs) but a yanked crate reds the daily scan. The rustls bump also moved the crypto provider beneath it: aws-lc-rs 1.16.3 → 1.18.1, aws-lc-sys 0.40.0 → 0.45.0, rustls-webpki 0.103.13 → 0.103.15. Plus **#185** (@antonmos): the `--app-switcher-hud` overlay restyled to the native Cmd+Tab look (translucent slab, screen-fit icon scaling, subtler selection ring) — opt-in, inert without the flag. The daily cargo-deny scan was RED 2026-09-15 → 09-17 on the rustls/cryptoki pair and is green again.) Earlier: **v0.9.6** (bug-fix patch — TWO things that shipped broken get
corrected, both @antonmos. **#179**: a v0.9.5 SCROLL-DOWN REGRESSION — the pin bump moved
`ironrdp-pdu` past its own wheel-decode fix (now proper two's-complement) but did NOT delete
vendored divergence-17's compensation, so it DOUBLE-corrected → every downward tick inflated
~255× (Windows App) / ~13% (mstsc), up untouched (the asymmetry = the fingerprint, macrdp
#113 in reverse). Div-17 RETIRED (pass-through) + an end-to-end round-trip test pins the
contract so a future pin-bump decode change fails in CI. **#180**: an UNAUTH remote DoS
latent since v0.9.3 — a single silent TCP connection wedged the second-client-preemption
accept loop (negotiate blocks on socket reads pre-auth; awaited unbounded → once the live
session ended the loop hung with no `select!` left, health-watchdog-INVISIBLE like the
v0.9.4 find_size DoS). Bounded by `CANDIDATE_NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT` (10 s) +
`CANDIDATE_HANDOFF_GRACE` (750 ms) + a regression test; the same PR also fixes 2 more div-23
preemption bugs (eviction event could disconnect the WINNER → discard-stale-before-serve;
uncapped anti-storm lockout barred the reclaim headline case → `REPREEMPT_MAX_LOCKOUT` 30 s).
Both found by the automated reviewer on upstream #1476, confirmed in the vendored copy; CI
green, merged #180=`3a66e46` + #179=`6eb3cb1`.) Earlier: **v0.9.5** (maintenance — the IronRDP dependency pin bumped
`879ffed8` → `a5d1c682` (133 commits) and vendored divergence *shrank*; **no user-facing
change, default runtime path functionally unchanged**. Retires TWO vendored forks — the
**`ironrdp-rdpeusb` crate** (its lenient USB-3 caps decode landed upstream; `src/rdpeusb.rs`
PORTED to a5d1c682's split control/device PDUs — **mstsc Xbox-controller USB redirect
live-verified on the bumped build**, proving the mstsc-strict interop fixes survived the
port) and **`ironrdp-async`** (the v0.9.4 DoS guard — DROPPED because a5d1c682 already
carries upstream **#1515**'s `find_size` hardening, so the pre-auth framing DoS is now fixed
*upstream in the pin*, not by a local vendor) — and **harvests one divergence** (QOI,
always-Rgb, upstream #1335+#1341). Absorbs into `src/`: honor-client-desktop-size, **rdpsnd
format selection #1359** (the crate now owns it → macrdp's `choose_audio_format` divergence
gone), and the **egfx frame-ack signature #1345**. Net **−2 vendored forks, −1 divergence**
(`vendor/` now holds 5 forks: acceptor/dvc/rdpdr/rdpeudp/server). VERIFIED end-to-end on
FreeRDP (CredSSP/audit, AAC, H.264) + mstsc (USB) + the four abuse-fuzz harnesses; **soaked
27.4 h on the Mac mini** (0 panics/0 restarts, RSS bounded avg 54 MB) alongside the
adversarial abuse suite — see `docs/pin-bump-soak-results.md`. Landed via PR #178. Deferred
de-drift: the honor-size server-half (divergence #9) + upstreamed-but-unreleased divergences
#5/#6/#13 drop on a future bump.) Earlier: **v0.9.4** (security hotfix — an UNAUTH, pre-TLS remote DoS: a single
malformed 2-byte fast-path frame (`04 00`/`00 00`) spun the vendored `ironrdp-async`
`Framed::read_by_hint` at 100% CPU (`read_exact(0)` in a non-yielding loop) and wedged the
acceptor's accept loop = whole-server outage; reachable before TLS/CredSSP so the auth-guard
never sees it and the health watchdog misses it (single-worker spin, runtime probe still
passes). Fixed by **vendoring `ironrdp-async`** (4-file crate, two-sided `[patch]` like
`ironrdp-dvc`) + the `read_by_hint` zero-length-unmatched-PDU guard = macrdp PR #1556
(commit `c541d09e`), complementing upstream #1515's `find_size` hardening. NO `src/` change.
Found by `soak_abuse3` decoder-fuzz. LIVE-VERIFIED: the 2-byte trigger ×10 → CPU 0.0% (no
spin/pegged thread), accept loop live, guard fires (`accept_begin failed`) = clean
per-connection rejection. The `ironrdp-async` vendor dir was DROPPED at the v0.9.5
a5d1c682 pin bump — a5d1c682 carries #1515, so this framing DoS is now fixed upstream in
the pin, not by a local vendor.) Earlier: **v0.9.3** (storm-guard fix + the connection/input batch —
a blank-recovery reliability fix plus four merged @antonmos contributions; **default runtime
path unchanged**. Headline: the mstsc/Windows-App reconnect-blank drop loop can no longer run
away. The reconnect-storm guard (`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DROPS`) reset its counter whenever a
connection presented as few as `min_render_reports` (3) frames — and a restart-while-connected
reconnect-blank half-heals under the reactivation (a ~4-frame run) then relapses + is dropped,
so that brief blip cleared the reset bar on EVERY cycle → the cap never tripped → infinite loop
(live-repro'd on a Windows client over ZeroTier). Fix (`src/h264.rs`, `storm_guard_should_reset`):
reset only on an **established** connection (~5 s sustained presentation), so a
brief-present-then-drop counts toward the cap → trips → cycle ends (session stays up +
close+reopen guidance). **LIVE-VERIFIED over ZeroTier**: guard tripped at 3 drops, 0 spurious
resets, where the same path previously cycled forever; unit-tested; removed the now-dead
`ever_presented`. The four contributions: **#174** a second client now TAKES OVER the live
session (full-auth-gated — an unauthenticated connection can never evict a live session; a weak
TPKT-peek gate was replaced) instead of hanging (vendored server divergence 23; upstream RFC
Devolutions/IronRDP#1483); **#175** a blank-recovery post-attempt heal-confirmation deadline
(`MACRDP_BLANK_RECOVERY_HEAL_CONFIRM_MS`, default 8 s — complements the storm-guard fix at the
other end of the loop); **#176** relative-mouse (`RelMove`) support + a `map_client_to_display`
edge-clamp to the display's last pixel (`s-1`, stops the cursor walking onto the shielded panel);
**#173** clipboard pre-connect-sync (skip the racy connect-time advertise). See
`docs/release-history.md`.)
Earlier: **v0.9.2** (blank-recovery clean-presentation latch — a
point release fixing a v0.9.1 regression in the mstsc/Windows-App reconnect-blank
auto-recovery; **default runtime path unchanged**, only the blank detector's disarm logic
changed. v0.9.1's #172 made the disarm *revocable* (to catch a client reporting nonzero-EDR
*while black*), which regressed the mirror client — one that **presents fine but reports
`timeDiffEDR == 0` mid-session**, whose short nonzero runs never reach the "established" bar —
so the aggressive path force-dropped its working ~50 s sessions and the ARC cookie reconnected
each time = a connect/disconnect loop on a session in active use. QoE decode+render-time is
*bidirectionally* unreliable, so no EDR threshold separates the two clients; the signal that
does is *when* the nonzero run occurs. Fix (`src/h264.rs`): a durable **`presented_clean`**
latch — a sustained nonzero-EDR run seen **before any recovery attempt** (`attempts == 0`)
proves the client painted the desktop at connect (not the reconnect-blank, which is black from
frame one), so the detector latches off for the connection = the v0.9.0 behavior, restored.
The `attempts == 0` guard preserves #172 (the blank client's nonzero-while-black flicker only
appears *after* its reactivation → latch withheld → escalation still recovers it).
LIVE-VERIFIED: a 6-min session held (was dropping every ~50 s) and a real reconnect-blank
still self-healed. Trade-off: a genuine *mid-session* blackout on a cleanly-presented
connection is no longer auto-recovered (unconfirmed case) — `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` is the manual
lever. **Known issue, deferred (NOT a regression):** a blank-recovery reactivation un-blanks
the `--capture-primary` physical panel (macOS resets gamma on the reconfiguration; the
same-size `Resize` skips the re-assert the resize path runs) — present since v0.8.27, only
noticed now; a gamma-timing reblank was flaky + reverted (`wip/capture-primary-reblank-on-heal`),
the robust fix is a shield-window helper (`--shield-primary` avoids the class). See
`docs/release-history.md` + the blank-recovery note in `@docs/known-quirks.md`.)
Earlier: **v0.9.1** (the lockable-headless release — a new
opt-in headless blanking mode **`--shield-primary`** covers the physical panel with an
opaque black *window* (via the `macrdpshield` helper) instead of capturing it, so unlike
`--capture-primary` **the Mac can still be locked** and there's no ~250 ms resize flash;
default OFF, capture/detach unchanged. Also: client-resolution auto-adopt on the
`--virtual-display` path (#165), a blank-recovery established-session tier (#172), a
majority-area `Ctrl+Alt+G` window-gather, and a `--detach-primary` launchd-restart stopgap
(#169) for the macOS-26 in-process panel-re-enable bug (#168, root fix still open). See
`docs/release-history.md` + the shield/lock notes in `@docs/known-quirks.md`.)
Earlier: **v0.9.0** (the webcam release — **a webcam
redirected from the client now presents as a REAL macOS camera**. Opt-in
`--enable-camera-redirection` (default OFF, default runtime path byte-identical when
off): tick "Video capturing devices" in the client and **"macrdp Camera"** appears in
Photo Booth / Zoom / FaceTime / Teams showing the client's live webcam. As far as is
known the **first *known* OSS RDP *server* to present a client-redirected webcam as a native
OS camera** (FreeRDP ships `channels/rdpecam/server/`, but that is a protocol
endpoint — it hands raw samples to a callback and never decodes or registers an OS
device; the first-ness is the end-to-end presentation, not speaking MS-RDPECAM) — and the path that actually works for **mstsc**, which routes webcams over
MS-RDPECAM and refuses the raw-USB reads (`0x8007001f`) the USB path needs. Pipeline:
H.264 samples over the MS-RDPECAM `RDCamera` DVC (plain TCP — UDP is NOT a prerequisite)
→ **VideoToolbox** decode to `420v` `CVPixelBuffer`s → macrdp as a **CoreMediaIO client**
enqueues them onto the **sink stream of a CoreMediaIO Camera system extension**
(IOSurface-backed ⇒ **zero-copy**) → the extension forwards to its source stream, which
apps see. LIVE-VERIFIED on real mstsc at 1080p/~30 fps, **zero dropped frames**. The
extension is **hand-assembled from a plain SwiftPM target — no Xcode** — signed +
notarized, activated once from the menu-bar controller ("Enable macrdp Camera…"; the
`system-extension.install` entitlement is self-serviceable, no Apple grant). Setup
runbook: `docs/camera-extension-setup.md`. **FOUR silent CMIO failure modes were found
and are documented there — read it before touching this, every one fails with NO error:**
(1) the `.systemextension` filename MUST equal its `CFBundleIdentifier`; (2)
`CMIOExtensionClient.signingID` is literally the string `"unknown"`, so sink-producer
auth is impossible and a rejecting hook surfaces as a bogus `CMIODeviceStartStream -4`;
(3) **`kCMIOStreamPropertyDirection` is INVERTED** vs the headers — pick the sink by
NAME, since starting the wrong stream RETURNS SUCCESS while nothing ever drains; (4)
macOS never replaces a same-`CFBundleVersion` system extension (monotonic build number
now). Also: a CMIO extension's `os_log` needs `sudo` to read, and every extension change
costs a reboot to test. Decode diagnostics are now opt-in behind `MACRDP_CAMERA_DUMP=1`.
Migrating the camera channel to UDP is scoped but deferred — TCP carries it fine.)
Earlier: **v0.8.40** (the headless-laptop release —
three fixes for daily headless-laptop use plus a which-client audit signal, **no
change to the default runtime path**; the first three are opt-in or headless-only.
**(1) Opt-in `--restore-windows-on-disconnect`** (config
`RESTORE_WINDOWS_ON_DISCONNECT=1`) makes windows follow you: the process-lifetime
virtual display strands its windows off-screen on disconnect (invisible on a
laptop's built-in panel), so this sweeps them back onto the built-in on disconnect
(Mac usable locally) and auto-gathers them onto the vd on reconnect (no
`Ctrl+Alt+G`) — reuses the gather machinery, default OFF (a remote-only server
wants windows to stay on the vd). Live-verified: 6 windows swept home. **(2) Dock
no longer disappears on disconnect** — follow-on to v0.8.39: `CapturedPrimary::
install` persists vd-as-main via `ConfigureForSession`, but `drop` reverted only
`ConfigureForAppOnly` (process-scoped), so the session store still said "vd is
main" while the physical went back to (0,0) and the Dock sometimes followed the
phantom vd off-screen; `drop` now persists the restore too (symmetric). **(3)
`--capture-primary` blanking survives a live resize** — a re-mode (`applySettings`)
is a display reconfiguration and macOS resets the gamma tables on one, un-blanking
the panel (which v0.8.39 keeps engaged, so nothing re-applied it → the desktop
STAYED showing); now `CapturedPrimary::reassert_blanking()` re-applies the all-black
LUT after the re-mode and after each post-resize gather sweep (the gather's relayout
re-resets gamma ~700 ms in). Dead ends confirmed live + removed: a
`CGDisplayRegisterReconfigurationCallback` NEVER fired (the private `applySettings`
resets gamma without a public reconfiguration event), and a timed polling burst
can't beat it (a gamma write DURING a reconfiguration doesn't stick). **Documented
residual (accepted):** a ~250 ms desktop flash WHILE the re-mode is in flight —
macOS shows the desktop during the reconfiguration and won't let gamma stick until
it commits; the only fix is a black shield-window helper process, not worth it for
a local-panel flash during an intentional resize. **(4) Client fingerprint audit
record** (`event="fingerprint"`, #163) names which RDP client connected —
`client_name`/`rdp_version`/`client_build`/`platform` from the handshake, in
`macrdp.log` + the opt-in SIEM JSON stream; fingerprinting not auth (spoofable) but
tells clients apart: mstsc=real Windows build+`WINDOWS`, FreeRDP=build 2600+`UNIX`,
Thincast=18363+`UNSPECIFIED`. See the vd-arrangement + capture-primary quirk notes.)
Earlier: **v0.8.39** (the smooth-resize release —
polish for live client-driven resize on the **headless** path, **no change to
the default runtime path**. Two fixes: **(1)** the headless overlay watcher
now **polls through the reactivation's transient session flap** (1→0→1, up to
a 2.5 s grace) instead of tearing down + re-engaging the headless capture on
every resize — killing the gamma flicker and the audio restart (#160); **(2)**
**the Dock + windows stay put across a re-mode** — root cause was the vd's
`(0,0)`/main placement being `ConfigureForAppOnly` (process-scoped, never
persisted), so every `applySettings` re-mode re-derived the arrangement from
the WindowServer's session store ("physical is main") and snapped the vd off
`(0,0)`: the Dock jumped to the blanked panel and a variable-timing relayout
kept re-stranding windows (sweep-retry proved whack-a-mole). Fixed with
**`ConfigureForSession`** — the store agrees, a re-mode has nothing to snap
back to; crash-safety unchanged (capture/gamma stay process-scoped; a dead
process's vanishing vd auto-restores the physical as main). Defense-in-depth:
a **synchronous** `reanchor_as_main` after each re-mode (off-thread it's too
late — the Dock has already settled) + a two-sweep post-resize auto-gather
(#162, closes #161). Live-verified consistent across maximize +
drag-between-monitors on real mstsc. See the vd-arrangement quirk note.)
Earlier: **v0.8.38** (the A/V resync hotkey — a small
feature release, **no change to the default runtime path**. Adds an on-demand
**`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R`** to recover a session gone stale after a long idle: an
mstsc session left idle for hours can blank the picture and drift the audio
(Windows' audiodg buffers playback downstream where the server can't observe it,
so auto-detection is a dead end). The chord — always-on like `Ctrl+Alt+G`,
Win-key-free so mstsc forwards it — forces a clean **IDR keyframe** (video, to
repaint the stale presentation) and **rebuilds the audio SCK stream** (so the
client's drifted backlog drains and re-syncs, the same effect as a
minimize→unminimize), with **no disconnect**. Live-verified on real mstsc:
un-blanked smoothly, audio resynced, zero flicker. The video uses an IDR rather
than the heavier core reactivation (`Gfx::request_reactivation`, kept as an
escalation) — the reactivation un-blanks too but on the
`--virtual-display`/`--capture-primary` headless path cascades into a visible
~1–2 s session re-cycle; the IDR is lighter and flicker-free. #159.) Earlier:
**v0.8.37** (live resize + the webcam stall
watchdog — two opt-in-path additions, **no change to the default runtime path**.
**Live client-driven resize (MS-RDPEDISP)**: when the client drags its window,
macrdp re-negotiates the session at the new size on the fly via a core
Deactivation–Reactivation (the same in-place machinery the mstsc blank-recovery
uses), re-moding a `--virtual-display` like a monitor changing resolution;
debounced so a drag settles to one reactivation. Verified on Windows App for
macOS (all session modes) + FreeRDP; a clean **no-op on mstsc** (it doesn't emit
the MS-RDPEDISP monitor-layout PDU on a window drag — DVC-traced — so no
regression). Contributed by Anton Mostovoy (#155). **USB webcam stall watchdog**:
a bulk webcam redirected over FreeRDP could stream then **freeze after a while
while the rest of the session kept working** — the read-ahead engine delivers
frame reads strictly in sequence order, and a bulk read the client never
completes (the camera stalls host-side: USB autosuspend / uvcvideo timeout /
bandwidth) was a permanent gap with no timeout, so the stream wedged until
re-attach. A `dispatch_source` watchdog (`usb_spike.m`) detects a stream waiting
with no in-order data for `MACRDP_USB_STREAM_STALL_MS` (default 3000; 0 disables),
completes the waiting ring head with a zero-length read → macOS re-COMMITs →
read-ahead re-engages when the client resumes, turning a transient host-side
stall into a self-recovering hiccup instead of a permanent freeze. The USB
read-ahead knobs (`USB_STREAM_STALL_MS`, `USB_PREFETCH_DEPTH`) are now
`config.env`-bridged. LIVE-VERIFIED on FreeRDP + an A4Tech webcam: a client-side
stall froze the picture, the watchdog fired at ~1.7–2.2 s, and the video resumed
in Photo Booth with no disconnect/crash (#158). Plus a README **Hotkeys**
section.) Earlier: **v0.8.36** (the fork-workers removal — a
cleanup release with **no change to the default runtime path** (single-process
was already the default). Removes the experimental **`--fork-workers`**
per-connection process model: a supervisor that `fork+exec`'d a fresh worker
process per RDP connection (xrdp's model), built to dodge mstsc's H.264 EGFX
reconnect-blank by giving each connection a fresh process. That blank has
**self-healed in place since v0.8.27** (a bare core Deactivation–Reactivation +
the Server Auto-Reconnect Cookie), and an exhaustive 2026-07-07 A/B found the
process model was a **net-negative** for interactive mstsc — mstsc opens an
abandoned extra TCP connection on each reconnect attempt, which stalled the
supervisor's serialized worker slot. So single-process + `--enable-h264` +
blank-recovery + ARC is now the only, field-proven model; a stale
`FORK_WORKERS=1` in a deployed `config.env` is ignored (unknown key), so existing
installs don't break. Net **−756 LOC** (−691 in `main.rs`); the GUI's
"Per-connection workers" toggle is gone too. Also lands **experimental
camera-redirection groundwork** (Phase 0, opt-in, inert by default):
**`--enable-camera-redirection`** negotiates the MS-RDPECAM
`RDCamera_Device_Enumerator` DVC and logs the client announcing its redirected
webcam — the protocol gate proving a modern mstsc/Win11 will hand macrdp a camera
over MS-RDPECAM (the channel USB redirection can't reach). It does **not** present
a camera yet (no per-device stream, no macOS capture); nothing changes when the
flag is off. Groundwork for a future native-macOS-camera feature.) Earlier:
**v0.8.35** (the USB read-ahead gate fix — a
one-fix point release over v0.8.34 reworking *how* the bulk-IN read-ahead engine
tells a streaming BULK endpoint apart from an HID interrupt endpoint, because
v0.8.34's method silently broke the **webcam**. Background: the v0.8.30 read-ahead
engine's `isBulkIn` test was address-only (non-EP0 IN + NormalTransfer), which an
**interrupt-IN pipe also satisfies**, so a redirected **gamepad enumerated but its
buttons did nothing** (v0.8.30 → v0.8.33; input reports at ~20 s instead of ~8 ms —
its interrupt pipe was routed into the streaming branch and only serviced on a
forced re-walk). **v0.8.34** gated instead on the endpoint's **declared** transfer
type (`is_bulk` from the client's SelectConfiguration pipe info, pushed to the ObjC
controller via `macrdp_usb_set_endpoint_bulk()`) — which fixed the gamepad but
**wrongly excluded the webcam**: a UVC video endpoint is frequently reported over
the wire with `is_bulk=false` (measured **69/81** on a redirected A4Tech cam), so
read-ahead never engaged and there was no image. **v0.8.35 gates on the transfer's
read LENGTH instead** — a reliable physical signal where the declared type is not:
a webcam's streaming bulk read is tens of KB (102656 B observed), an HID interrupt
poll is ≤ `wMaxPacketSize` (64 B), so the `isBulkIn` gate now requires
`normalReadLen >= 512`. The webcam's large reads engage read-ahead (byte-identical
to the known-good v0.8.33 path) while the gamepad's tiny polls stay serial; the
`is_bulk` plumbing is removed. Load-bearing: moving the size check up into the
`walkEndpoint:` gate — not just inside `engageStream:`, where v0.8.30–0.8.33 had it
— is what stops an interrupt endpoint's control flow from diverging into the
streaming branch at all. Live-verified: gamepad buttons work (1140 reports, stayed
serial), webcam read-ahead engages (`readLen=102656`, depth 4). **Don't re-break
it: at the UserHCI ring an interrupt endpoint is indistinguishable from a bulk one
by address + msg-type, AND by the wire-declared `is_bulk` flag — only the read
length reliably separates them. Whether *mstsc* then delivers a webcam's frames is
client-side (it prefers its own camera-redirection channel and can refuse the
raw-USB transfers with `0x8007001f`); the FreeRDP bulk-webcam path is unchanged.**)
Earlier: **v0.8.34** (the gamepad-input fix — the first repair of the above
gamepad regression, via the `is_bulk` declared-type gate that v0.8.35 replaces).
Earlier: **v0.8.33** (the audit-forwarding release — a
SIEM/SOC observability roll-up over v0.8.32, no change to the default runtime
path; everything here is opt-in + default-off and byte-identical when off. **Opt-in
structured JSON audit stream** (`--audit-file` / `MACRDP_AUDIT_JSON=1`, config
`AUDIT_FILE`): the per-connection `macrdp::audit` events (accept / reject / auth /
disconnect, with source IP+port, reason, outcome) are also written as one
schema-versioned JSON object per line on a dedicated self-rotating file for a
standard log collector (Vector / Fluent Bit / rsyslog / Splunk UF) to tail and
forward to a SIEM — macrdp deliberately does **not** speak network syslog (the
collector owns TLS/buffering/backpressure; macOS has no syslogd). The
human-readable `macrdp.log` audit lines are unchanged; the JSON file is an
additional sink, emitted **independent of `RUST_LOG`** (a `Targets` filter pins
`macrdp::audit=INFO`) so a quiet operational filter never suppresses security
events. New explicit **`event="auth"` login verdict** (`outcome="success"` when
CredSSP/NLA validates, else `"did_not_complete"` + a short `reason`), emitted once
per connection **after** the TLS upgrade — single-process path — so a SOC sees the
real authentication result instead of inferring it from the connection-duration
heuristic. The audit `reason` is **control-char-stripped** (log-injection
defense for the human-readable logfmt sink, which writes fields verbatim; the JSON
sink was already serde-safe) and length-bounded, never carrying credential
material. New `docs/audit-log.md` (per-event/-field interpretation guide with
worked examples) + `docs/siem-forwarding.md` (collector configs). An **end-to-end
CI job** drives a real FreeRDP `+auth-only` CredSSP handshake (correct + wrong
password) against a loopback server and asserts the JSON audit writes
(`scripts/test-audit-log.sh`) — a `cargo test` can't drive CredSSP (the harness is
TLS-only). Also lands inert isoch-USB observe-only groundwork (no functional
change).) Earlier: **v0.8.32** (the security-hardening release — a
security-focused roll-up over v0.8.31, no change to the default runtime path.
**Fuzzed the network-facing protocol decoders** with new in-tree `cargo-fuzz`
harnesses: `ironrdp-rdpeudp` (raw-UDP multitransport) came through ~250M execs
clean, but `ironrdp-rdpeusb` (URBDRC / USB-redirection PDUs) surfaced **3 real
panics** — unchecked `read_slice` on a truncated PDU in `TsUrbResult` /
`IoControlCompletion` / `TsUsbdInterfaceInfoResult` — now `ensure_size!`-guarded
(107M execs clean after; already fixed upstream, so they drop on the pin bump).
**`--max-client-size WxH`** (config `MAX_CLIENT_SIZE`) caps the client-requested
auto-adopt resolution, closing the audit residual where an authenticated client
could request 8192×8192 (~256 MB BGRA/frame); clamps in-band per-dimension,
refuses out-of-band, opt-in + byte-identical when unset, mirrors upstream #1404.
**Bounded the smart-card IFD-bridge `CMD_TRANSMIT`** allocation (was a 4 GB local
DoS on an unbounded wire `u32`) and documented the unauthenticated-loopback trust
boundary for the three helper channels. Added **scheduled `cargo-deny`** dep-vuln
scanning (daily, hardened runner, separate workflow). Plus **`--alt-backtick-switch`**
(Option+\` cycles the current app's windows, the Option analogue of
`--alt-tab-switch`; also fixes headless frontmost detection to read the AX
system-wide focused app), and the **blank-recovery + auto-reconnect tunables are
now `config.env` keys** (`BLANK_RECOVERY=0` etc. no longer need a plist edit).
Two contributions from Anton Mostovoy: the alt-backtick work and a
virtual-display descriptor-serial fix (per-pid, so two concurrent vd instances
don't collide). Earlier: **v0.8.31** (the gamepad-resilience release — a
one-fix point release over v0.8.30 hardening HID/gamepad USB redirection: a
redirected device's **interrupt-IN endpoint** (e.g. an Xbox controller's
input-report pipe) no longer goes dead when the client fails a single interrupt
read. mstsc intermittently completes an interrupt read with `hresult 0x8007001f`
(`ERROR_GEN_FAILURE`) while the device channel is still open; surfacing that as an
endpoint STALL made the macOS class driver give up polling the pipe (the gamepad
"hung" after seconds). The server (`src/usb_redirect/mod.rs`) now treats a
**channel-still-open transient failure on an interrupt endpoint as an empty poll**
(0 bytes, success) so the OS keeps the pipe alive and re-polls — matching interrupt
"no data ready" semantics (one dropped report is imperceptible; the next poll gets
fresh state). Scoped strictly to interrupt endpoints (`is_bulk == false`), so
mass-storage **bulk** keeps the strict stall (a real bulk error surfaces; a short
read never corrupts a transfer) and link death (`channel closed`) stays fatal for
clean teardown. Log marker: `interrupt-IN transient failure — completing as an
empty poll to keep the pipe alive`. Field note: a physically loose/jostled USB
cable causes the same dead-gamepad symptom (a real disconnect + re-enumeration —
`status=11` → `endpoint created ep=0x00` in the log) and is *not* software-fixable;
reseat the cable, which this fix correctly leaves alone.) Earlier: **v0.8.30**
(the webcam release — a
**bulk USB webcam redirected over FreeRDP now streams live video** into the Mac
session (`--enable-usb-redirection`, entitled build) — as far as is known a first
for any open-source RDP *server*. The blocker was USB **read-depth starvation**,
not the (separate, mstsc-only) camera-channel limit: macOS double/triple-buffers a
streaming bulk-IN endpoint (queuing several concurrent reads so the device pipe
never runs dry), but the user-space host controller's transfer ring exposes only
one transfer at a time, so serving reads one-at-a-time starved the camera (no data
→ macOS tore the stream down), while re-forwarding the same read for depth dropped
half the frame data. A **bulk-IN read-ahead engine** (`src/usb_redirect/usb_spike.m`)
now keeps `MACRDP_USB_PREFETCH_DEPTH` (default 4) concurrent `bulk_transfer_in`
reads in flight to the client, decoupled from the ring, buffered in **sequence
order** and delivered one chunk per ring transfer — restoring URB depth with no
data loss. Gated on the endpoint's **real transfer type** (the client's
SelectConfiguration pipe info), so **mass storage** (regression-verified
byte-exact) streams and **interrupt/HID** (the redirected gamepad) stays on the
serial path. That gate was originally address-only and silently broke HID input
from v0.8.30 to v0.8.33 — a redirected gamepad enumerated but its buttons did
nothing; fixed 2026-07-14, see the USB quirk note. No Rust change to the
transfer path (the URBDRC/`UsbHandle` side is already
per-token concurrent). Verified live on an A4Tech bulk UVC cam over Linux FreeRDP
(smooth video in Photo Booth); isochronous webcams + the mstsc camera-redirection
channel remain unimplemented. See the USB feature note in `@docs/features.md`.
Earlier: **v0.8.29** (the stability release —
a bug-fix roll-up over v0.8.28: closes a rare clipboard-churn **crash** (a
use-after-free from unsynchronized `NSPasteboard` access, now serialized behind a
process-global guard, #144); fixes a **scroll-wheel runaway** on the macOS Windows
App where a gentle scroll-down jumped to the bottom of the page — `ironrdp-pdu`
mis-decodes the 9-bit wheel-rotation field as sign-magnitude instead of two's
complement, so `-1..-3` deltas arrived as `-255..-253`; corrected at the vendored
handler (divergence (17)) plus per-event scroll accumulation, issue #113/#140;
stops a redirected **Xbox controller's Guide button** from tearing down the
USB-redirection session (its `SET_FEATURE` control-OUT is now routed via
`TRANSFER_IN` and the URBDRC send path is encode-tolerant, so no malformed URB can
kill the session); and makes `packaging/make-app.sh` auto-prefer a stable
self-signed `macrdp-dev` signing identity so Screen-Recording/Accessibility TCC
grants survive dev rebuilds — ad-hoc's cdhash-keyed identity does not, #141.
Earlier: **v0.8.28** (the gather-windows release — an
on-demand hotkey **`Ctrl+Alt+G`** (`Ctrl+Option+G`) sweeps windows stranded off
the virtual display in the headless modes (`--capture-primary`/`--detach-primary`)
back onto the display the client sees. In those modes the client sees the virtual
display, which occupies a different region of global coordinate space than the
physical panel, so a window opened on the physical panel before connecting is
invisible/unclickable over RDP; the hotkey walks each regular Dock app's
`AXWindows` via Accessibility and moves any window entirely off the target
display to just inside its top-left (partly-visible windows untouched). **Manual
by design** — an on-connect auto-gather was built first and rejected as too
surprising; the chord is Win-key-free so mstsc forwards it, and no-op when there's
no virtual display. Live-verified on real mstsc. See the stranded-windows quirk
note. Earlier: **v0.8.27** (the reconnect-blank-cracked
release — the mstsc reconnect-blank, documented for months as a not-server-
fixable client surface-retention bug, now **self-heals in place in ~4 s with no
disconnect**: on a detected blank the server sends a bare core RDP
Deactivation–Reactivation (Server Deactivate All → new Demand Active) that
**preserves the EGFX channel/surface** — no DeleteSurface, no DYNVC close, no
RESET_GRAPHICS, all of which were exhaustively proven client-fatal — and
mstsc re-maps its retained surface 0 and presents again. Live-verified 9/9
blanks healed on real mstsc/WiFi, EDR=0 → presenting in ~1-2 s, zero drops.
Default recovery action (`BlankAction::Reactivate`); the old connection-drop is
now only the fallback. Detection sped up via a wall-clock fast-path (~70 s →
~4 s on a static blank). Still RTT/QoE-gated so FreeRDP + high-latency links are
untouched. Zero vendored-server change — a no-op `DisplayUpdate::Resize` reuses
the existing reactivation path. See the reconnect-blank quirk note. Earlier:
**v0.8.26** (the roaming-client release —
UDP multitransport now configures and cleans up after itself, making
`ENABLE_LOSSY_AUDIO`/`ENABLE_UDP_MULTITRANSPORT` safe to leave permanently on
for a client that moves between networks: **RTT-gated offer** — links measured
at/above `MACRDP_UDP_OFFER_MAX_RTT_MS` (80 ms) at accept are never offered UDP
and run plain TCP from the first byte, so overlay links have no tunnel to wedge
(#136); **tunnel-lifecycle hardening** — an ended session's abandoned tunnel
retires quietly instead of triggering the 10-min offer cooldown (the false
cooldown that silently downgraded healthy-LAN reconnects, observed live), while
a tunnel that wedged BEFORE its session ended is still adjudicated as dead so
the reset-cycle protection can't be laundered away; offer cookies are evicted
on every connection end (was: leaked per failed handshake, with a
late-tunnel-bind zombie-peer window); all three peer-removal sites now lower
the shared bound flag (#137/#138/#139). Triple
adversarially reviewed; docs de-drifted.)
Earlier: **v0.8.25** (the resilient-link release —
three session-killers fixed, all live-verified over ZeroTier incl. mobile:
**oversized-cursor clamp** — a shake-to-locate/enlarged cursor at Retina backing
pixels overflowed the pointer PDU's u16 mask and the encode error tore down the
whole session, now downscaled to fit (#134); **link-aware blank recovery** —
kernel TCP RTT sampled per connection at accept gates the detector: evidence
window scales with RTT and the drop lever is withheld ≥80 ms, where the EDR==0
signal is untrustworthy and the false drops themselves poisoned mstsc into a
real permanent black (#135); **RTT-seeded adaptive bitrate** — slow links start
at ceiling/3 and climb instead of overshooting the pipe (#135); **UDP
tunnel-death detection + offer cooldown** — a wedged tunnel falls audio back to
TCP in ~30 s and suppresses multitransport offers so mstsc's dead-tunnel reset
reconnects as a stable plain-TCP session, breaking the reset cycle (#133).)
Earlier: **v0.8.24** (the remote-link release: RTT-aware
adaptive rate control — standing-queue-delay signal, no-ack distress fallback,
IDR backoff on both transports, ZeroTier-verified; Windows App for Android
support via channel-level EGFX decline; 2× faster blank recovery; parked idle
pollers. Lossy audio is LAN/WiFi-only until the UDP-tunnel keepalive lands.)
Earlier: **v0.8.23**
(the production-readiness arc — Tier 1 + Tier 2.5 of
`@docs/production-readiness-roadmap.md`: operator-supplied TLS certs `--cert`/`--key`,
connection rate-limiting + lockout + an auth audit log, bounded log rotation + a
startup reaper, and — v0.8.23 — a **health-check watchdog** (`src/health.rs`) that
bounces a hung-but-alive process so launchd
restarts a fresh one, closing the gap `KeepAlive` couldn't. v0.8.22 auto-recovers
the mstsc EGFX reconnect-blank via QoE-EDR detection + a Server Auto-Reconnect
Cookie; v0.8.21 fixed an auth-guard false-lockout of a legitimately reconnecting
client — surfaced by the Tier 2.4 soak).
RDP clients (mstsc, Microsoft Remote Desktop, FreeRDP) connect over TLS and get
the macOS desktop with keyboard/mouse/clipboard/audio, optional H.264-over-EGFX,
headless virtual displays, drive + smart-card redirection, and (opt-in) UDP
multitransport. See `@docs/features.md` for the full, current capability list and
the per-feature caveats; not-yet-implemented items are called out there too.

## Project goal

A native RDP server for macOS written in Rust on top of [`ironrdp`](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP). Functionally analogous to `xrdp` on Linux: Windows / cross-platform RDP clients connect to the Mac and see its desktop, with keyboard/mouse forwarded back.

Not a client, not a VNC bridge, not a proxy — the server terminates the RDP protocol itself and renders/feeds the local macOS session.
